- **note** n8n charges some money for its cloud service but
- **note** n8n is a open source so we can use it for free also
- 
---
- Best and smart approach is to use a VPS with pre-conficurged n8n templet
- this gives you a server running 24/7 which is already installed and confingured
- 
- It provides you
- unlimited workflows
- unlimited executions
- Complete data control: complete control over your data
---
- with self-hosting, you're paying a frection of that cost while getting unlimited everything
- For this setup, we can use Hostinger because they have a dedicated n8n template that does all the technical setup automatically

- you are about to have your own automation server
